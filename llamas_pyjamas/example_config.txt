#### This is a template configuration file to run the LLAMAS pipeline
#Its main purpose is to allow users to point to the files and directories that they
#wish to use for their data reduction
#The paths must be given as complete paths to ensure they can be found
#if files cannot be found or processed then the pipeline defaults to the master calibration files
