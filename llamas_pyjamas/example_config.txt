#### This is a template configuration file to run the LLAMAS pipeline
#Its main purpose is to allow users to point to the files and directories that they
#wish to use for their data reduction
#The paths must be given as complete paths to ensure they can be found
#if files cannot be found or processed then the pipeline defaults to the master calibration files

bias_file = 'path_to_bias.fits'
#example of a list of bias files to combine into a median master bias
#bias_file = 'file1.fits', 'file2.fits', 'file3.fits'
flat_file = 'path_to_flat.fits'
science_file = 'path_to_science_file' ##will make this a list later for stacking jobs
